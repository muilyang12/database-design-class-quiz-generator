            "**Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model?**  \n",
            "A: The primary purpose of the EER Model is to provide a more expressive data modeling technique that enhances the traditional Entity-Relationship (ER) Model by incorporating concepts such as specialization, generalization, and categorization.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q2: In the EER model, what is specialization?**  \n",
            "A: Specialization is the process of defining a set of sub-entities of a higher-level entity type and forming a hierarchy. It allows for the creation of more specific entities that inherit attributes and relationships from the parent entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q3: How does generalization differ from specialization in the EER model?**  \n",
            "A: Generalization is the process of extracting common characteristics from a set of entities to create a higher-level entity type. It consolidates multiple entities into a single entity that represents their shared attributes and relationships.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q4: What is an attribute in the context of the EER model?**  \n",
            "A: An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity type in the EER model. Attributes represent the data that can be stored for each entity instance, such as name, age, or date of birth.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q5: What role do weak entities play in the EER model?**  \n",
            "A: Weak entities are entities that cannot be uniquely identified by their own attributes alone. They depend on a \"strong\" or \"owner\" entity, and their existence is contingent upon the existence of the strong entity. Weak entities have a partial key that, when combined with the key of the strong entity, can uniquely identify them.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q6: Define the term 'category' in the EER model.**  \n",
            "A: A category in the EER model is a unique entity type that is defined to represent a union of multiple different entity types. It allows for a single entity to represent instances of multiple types while sharing common attributes.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q7: What is a relationship type in the EER model?**  \n",
            "A: A relationship type in the EER model defines the associations between entity types. It describes how entities interact with one another and can have attributes of their own, representing properties of the relationship.\n",

            "**Q8: Identify one advantage of using the EER model over the basic ER model.**  \n",
            "A: One advantage of using the EER model over the basic ER model is its ability to represent more complex data structures, including inheritance through specialization and generalization, which allows for better representation of real-world scenarios.\n",

            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q9: What notation is commonly used to represent EER diagrams?**  \n",
            "A: EER diagrams commonly use a notation that extends the standard ER diagram notation, incorporating symbols to represent various features like specialization, generalization, and categorization, such as ovals for attributes, diamonds for relationships, and rectangles for entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q10: What is a supertype/subtype relationship in the EER model?**  \n",
            "A: A supertype/subtype relationship is a hierarchical relationship where a supertype represents a generalized entity type that shares common attributes with its subtypes, which are more specialized entities. This relationship allows for better organization and flexibility in data modeling.\n",
